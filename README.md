# recommend-a-movie
This python scripts prompts the user to type the title of a movie, then calls the tastedive.com API and gives a list of up to 20 movies similar to the one the user typed.
The file contains a lot of comments as I write and publish these scripts as educational content. This is a good example of how you can create an app using a REST API, this script also contant an id statment to watn the user if the program did not find any movie!

Visit https://tastedive.com/read/api to read the documentatoin and make sure to register and receive an API key if you create an app that uses the API regularly!
Yuo can also get similar info about other medias like songs!
